Adjust the complexity of the flashcards based on the difficulty level:

- For "easy" difficulty:
  • Use simple vocabulary and straightforward concepts.
  • Focus on basic facts and definitions.
  • For multiple-choice, make the correct answer more obvious.

- For "medium" difficulty:
  • Use more advanced vocabulary and introduce some complexity.
  • Include some application of concepts, not just facts.
  • For multiple-choice, make distractors (incorrect options) more plausible.

- For "hard" difficulty:
  • Use technical vocabulary and complex concepts.
  • Focus on analysis, synthesis, and evaluation of ideas.
  • For multiple-choice, use very plausible distractors (incorrect options).
  • Include some edge cases or exceptions to rules.

Always ensure the content is accurate and relevant to the topic.
